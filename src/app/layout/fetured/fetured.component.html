        <h4>Fetured Project</h4>
        <h2>Pilot Page</h2>
        <p>
            This project was build for my Dutch friend, the Live View and the code was santitised from his contact information by his request. The actual page was taken down when
            he changed the line of work, but was up for few months before that.
            Itâ€™s a static page using HTML and SCSS with addition of ScrollReveal
            for the scroll animation. And the form was handled by PHP, 
            it's not included, as it was very simple mail function
