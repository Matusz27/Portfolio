        <h2>Pilot Page</h2>
        <p>
            This page was created for a Dutch client.
            I cleaned the code from his contact information at his request.
            The original page was taken down after he changed his line of work but was
            operational for a good few months. Itâ€™s a static page using HTML and SCSS 
            with the addition of ScrollReveal for the scroll animation.
