        <h4>Fetured Project</h4>
        <h2>Pilot Page</h2>
        <p>
            this project was built for a Dutch client. 
            The Live View and the code were sanitised from his contact 
            information at his request. The actual page has been taken 
            down when he changed the line of work, but was up for a 
            few months. Itâ€™s a static page using HTML and SCSS with 
            the addition of ScrollReveal for the scroll animation.
